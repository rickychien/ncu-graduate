Simple Metro PHP Gallery (SMPG)
http://metro.windowswiki.info/smpg/

Simple Metro PHP Gallery (SMPG) is a leightweight, easy to use gallery
script inspired by the Metro UI with support for .PNG, .JPG and .GIF image
files. It generates thumbnails for faster loading times and uses a slightly
modified version of the Lightbox 2 script by Lokesh Dhakar for displaying
your images. It is also fully HTML5 and CSS3 compliant.

For support issues, bug reports or feature requests, feel free to drop me a
mail at admin@windowswiki.info.

Requirements

    A web server capable of running PHP 5 scripts with the PHP GD Library
    installed.

Usage

    Upload all files to your webserver and put your photo albums inside the
    galleries folder. SMPG automatically creates thumbnails for your images
    — in order to do that, you must set write permissions (CHMOD 0777) to
    the galleries folder and each of its subfolders.

Known issues

    Album (folder) or image (file) names containing special characters are
    not yet supported. This will be fixed in the next release.
